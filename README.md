# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

The analysis is to generate a list of all employees who are eligible for the retirement package as well as provided a count of employee positions by department that will need to be filled due to the retirements.

After presenting results from the pervious analysis, a brand new analysis was called that required two (2) anaylsises to further help Pewlett Hackard prepare for what they called the "silver tsunami" as many current employees are about to reach retirement age. Further queries were written and executed for these deliverables to create the databases which are exported into CSV files.

To determine the number of retiring employees per title.
To identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

Majority of the employees who are retiring soon holds senior level titles, which is signaling a high impact result of the upcoming "silver tsunami" to the company's resources. The summary of the employee count who are retiring is broken down by titles which can be seen in the above table under deliverable 1 results. Further, a list of retiring employees' names along with their most recent title is also provided in a CSV file. 

There is a total of 1,549 qualified, retirement ready employees in the various departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. The list of employees that have mentorship eligibility is also provided in a CSV file. Majority of the employees on this list do hold similar senior positions and/or titles who can therefore help in ensuring that the company can train upcoming employees and lessen the impact of the "silver tsunami".
