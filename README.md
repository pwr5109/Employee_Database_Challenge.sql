# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

The analysis is to generate a list of all employees who are eligible for the retirement package as well as provided a count of employee positions by department that will need to be filled due to the retirements.

After presenting results from the pervious analysis, a brand new analysis was called that required two new analysis to further help Pewlett Hackard prepare for what they called the "silver tsunami" as many current employees are about to reach retirement age. Further analysis were used to create results that will help determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results

Based on the analysis results, there are quite a lot of employees that are going to retire. The company will need to fill total of 90,398 positions across various titles, and majority of them are retiring soon, who hold senior level titles, which will cause a high impact on the companies efficiency. The summary of the employee count who are retiring is broken down by titles, and a list of retiring employees names and their recent title are provided for reference. 

There are a total of 1,549 qualified, retirement-ready employees in the various departments to teach the younger employees. The list of employees who have mentorship eligibility are provided in the csv files I have attached. Majority of the employees on this analysis have very similar senior titles, so therefore this can help insure that training can be evenly given to the younger employees and lower the impact of the "silver tsunami".

## Overall Summary

About 1940 employees are eligible for mentorship, 90398 employees are retiring, so there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in each of the departments to train the next group of younger employees.
